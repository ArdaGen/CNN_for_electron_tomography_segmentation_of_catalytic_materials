## Semantic Segmentation of &gamma;-Alumina/Pt catalytic material in 3D HAADF STEM Tomography

Repository for the code used in " A Deep Learning Approach for Semantic Segmentation of Unbalanced Data in Electron Microscopy of Catalytic Materials."

Python scripts for :
* U-Net model
* Train model
* Evaluate model: DSC, recall, precision scores

Training and validation data sets include ground-truth images and corresponding annotations. 
* number of classes : 3
  
  Class labels : 
  
  Background/Pores : 0,  &gamma;-Alumina : 1, Pt nanoparticles : 2
* Image sets are 512x512 pixels patches.

  45 images for training and 15 images for validation
