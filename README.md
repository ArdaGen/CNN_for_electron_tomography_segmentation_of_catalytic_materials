### Multi-class CNN Segmentation of 3D HAADF STEM Reconstructions of &gamma;-Alumina/Pt catalytic material
***
Repository for the code used in " A Deep Learning Approach for Semantic Segmentation of Unbalanced Data in Electron Microscopy of Catalytic Materials".

Python scripts for :
* U-Net model
* Train
* Evaluation

Training and validation data sets include ground-truth images and annotations. 
* 3 classes : Background/Pores : 0,  &gamma;-Alumina : 1, Pt nanoparticles : 2
* Each images and masks are 512x512 pixels patches.

  45 training and 15 validation images and masks.
